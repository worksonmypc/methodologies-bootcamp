# Shopping Basket Kata

Our online shop will from time to time apply special offers to various products on our store. These generally change week by week to generate more traffic to our store.

We need to able to apply the discount at the checkout so that the correct price is displayed to the customer before payment is made.

This week, we plan to offer the following discounts on our products:

| Item | Price | Special Offer |
| ---- | ----- | ------------- |
| A    | 50    | 3 for 130     |
| B    | 30    | 2 for 45      |
| C    | 20    |               |
| D    | 15    |               |
